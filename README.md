## **Installation**

To get started with the Raj Ply House React project, follow the steps below:

### 1. **Clone the repository:**

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-hardware-store.git
```

### 2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

```bash
cd react-hardware-store
```

### 3. **Install dependencies:**

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before starting the project, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: You can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org).
2. **npm** (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js, so if you have Node.js installed, you also have npm.

You can verify if these are installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## **Running the Development Server**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. By default, the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

## **Building for Production**

To create a production-ready build of the app, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle the app into static files in the `build/` directory. These files can be served with any static file server. You can deploy the production build to services like Netlify, Vercel, or any other hosting provider.
